# SNHU-CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects, I explored how different data structures affect the performance and organization of information within a program. The first project focused on analyzing the run-time and memory trade-offs of various data structures, while the second centered on implementing a sorting algorithm to organize a list of courses in alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

My approach involved studying how data structures can be applied to efficiently store and access information. I relied on guided examples, documentation, and support tools to better understand how arrays, linked lists, and hash tables differ in use and performance. This helped me appreciate why choosing the right structure matters when building scalable and responsive programs.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I felt stuck, I leaned on structured examples and reference materials to clarify concepts. While I often used these resources to move forward, I also took time afterward to review what the solution was doing and why it worked. That reflection process helped bridge gaps in my understanding.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It’s shown me that understanding why a data structure is used is just as important as knowing how to implement it. I’ve learned to think more critically about performance and organization rather than just getting a program to run.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This course made me more aware of how small design choices affect readability and adaptability.
